## Relations

To use this mod, you need the [Mixin Bootstrap Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixinbootstrap).

## Behaviour:

**Huge Mushrooms** can grow at random tick with a chance of 1:25 like trees. A difference to trees is, that Huge Mushrooms can only grow on specific blocks. On **Mycelium** and **Podzol** a mushroom can grow at any light level, but on **Dirt** and **Grass Block** it can only grow at light level below 13. 
These blocks are configurable with the tags _extendedmushrooms:mushroom_growing_blocks_ and _extendedmushrooms:mushroom_growing_blocks_lightlevel_.

The blocks of a **Huge Mushroom** have also a changed behaviour. **Mushroom Stem Block** drops itself and can be used as a new wood type. **Brown and Red Mushroom Blocks** drop a related mushroom with a chance of 0.3 (with Fortune up to 0.9). With **Shears** or a tool with **Silk Touch** enchantment you can get the block itself. It can be used as **Wool** to craft for example a red or brown bed.

## Blocks:
